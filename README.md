# SS2_Krak Facial Recognition

## Goals
Create an ofline based solution that scans through images to detect faces and classify them into corresponding folders of detected individuals.

## Aproach
We will go for a classic step by step approach (no fancy agile stuff).
We first do some reasearch on the existing libraries and solutions to decide of the main structure of the project (RestAPI, simple software, the language we will use, etc.)
Here is a link to some recap of our research. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1se5Ws6fZhWPJTij3XwhDr88rqCTGqjgQR-bZHo2Us04/edit?usp=sharing
